# Secure Data Handling Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for secure data handling in the Data Grabber application, with a focus on complete data destruction after analysis.

## Core Security Principles

1. **Zero Persistence**: No sensitive data should remain on disk after analysis completes
2. **Isolated Processing**: Data analysis happens in a controlled environment 
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security to prevent data leakage
4. **Verifiable Destruction**: Users can verify data has been completely destroyed
5. **Local Processing Only**: Data never leaves the user's machine

## Architecture Components

### 1. Secure Storage Layer

- **Encrypted Temporary Storage**
  - All data is stored in an encrypted container during processing
  - Encryption keys held only in memory, never written to disk
  - Container auto-destructs on process completion or termination

- **Memory-Only Processing**
  - Critical data processing occurs in memory whenever possible
  - Memory is explicitly zeroed after use
  - Protection against memory dumps and hibernation files

### 2. Network Isolation

- **Firewall Configuration**
  - Optional temporary firewall rules to block outbound connections during analysis
  - Prevent accidental data exfiltration by third-party libraries

- **Network Activity Monitoring**
  - Log and alert on any unexpected network activity during analysis
  - Option to terminate process if unexpected network activity detected

### 3. Secure Deletion System

- **Multi-Pass Overwrites**
  - Implementation of DoD-standard secure deletion for temporary files
  - Platform-specific secure deletion (different methods for different filesystems)
  
- **Storage Media Consideration**
  - Special handling for SSDs vs HDDs (TRIM commands, etc.)
  - Awareness of filesystem journaling and how it impacts secure deletion

- **Destruction Verification**
  - Verification process to confirm data has been destroyed
  - Reporting to user on secure destruction status

### 4. Runtime Isolation

- **Process Sandboxing**
  - Restriction of process capabilities during analysis
  - Prevention of unauthorized file access outside designated areas

- **Memory Protection**
  - Protection against memory scraping
  - Prevention of core dumps and swap file leakage

## Implementation Plan

1. Create secure temporary storage system
2. Implement platform-specific secure deletion utilities
3. Develop network isolation mechanism
4. Build process sandboxing components
5. Create verification system for data destruction
6. Implement memory protection features
7. Design unified API for secure operations

## Usage Flow

1. User selects data source (e.g., Gmail emails)
2. System creates encrypted temporary storage
3. Data is imported into temporary storage
4. Analysis runs in isolated environment
5. Results are presented to user
6. All temporary data is securely destroyed
7. System verifies and reports successful destruction

## Technologies and Libraries

- **Encryption**: Node.js crypto module, libsodium
- **Secure Deletion**: Custom implementation of platform-specific methods
- **Process Isolation**: OS-specific sandboxing APIs
- **Memory Protection**: Custom memory handling utilities

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| System crash during processing | Recovery protocol that prioritizes data destruction |
| Third-party library network access | Network blocking and monitoring |
| Filesystem caching/journaling | Platform-specific secure deletion techniques |
| Memory analysis attacks | Memory zeroing and protection |
| Incomplete data destruction | Multiple verification methods |
